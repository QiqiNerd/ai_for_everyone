# Week 4 – Lesson 7: AI and Jobs

AI has been described as "automation on steroids." Before the rise of AI, automation already had a significant impact on many jobs, and with AI's capabilities expanding, the potential impact on jobs is accelerating. But how many jobs will be displaced, and how many new jobs will be created? While no one has definitive answers, let's explore some studies and try to understand what lies ahead.

## 1. Job Displacement and Creation Estimates (工作岗位的流失与创造估计)

### 1.1 McKinsey's Estimates (麦肯锡的估计)
McKinsey Global Institute estimated that **400 to 800 million jobs** (4亿到8亿工作岗位) could be displaced by AI automation by **2030** (到2030年). These are substantial numbers, but they also note that the number of jobs created by AI may be even larger than those lost.

### 1.2 Goldman Sachs' Estimates (高盛的估计)
Other studies, like those from **Goldman Sachs** (高盛), estimate **300 million jobs lost** by **2033** (到2033年), which is a lower estimate compared to McKinsey's.

### 1.3 Uncertainty and Optimism (不确定性与乐观)
While these numbers vary, many studies suggest that AI's impact on jobs will be significant. However, there is hope, as some studies suggest that **more jobs will be created** than displaced, especially in new sectors that may not even exist today.

## 2. Estimating Job Displacement (估计工作岗位流失)

### 2.1 Task-based Analysis (基于任务的分析)
To estimate job displacement, researchers break down **jobs into tasks** (工作任务) and estimate how automatable each task is. For example, radiologists or taxi drivers perform tasks, and if many of these tasks are automatable, the risk of the entire job being displaced increases.

### 2.2 The Role of AI in Task Automation (AI在任务自动化中的角色)
Rather than viewing AI as replacing jobs, it's more useful to think of AI as automating tasks. Many jobs will be impacted by the automation of certain tasks, but not necessarily by the entire job being replaced.

## 3. Jobs Most Susceptible to AI Automation (最容易被AI自动化的工作)

### 3.1 McKinsey's Top 10 Jobs for AI Automation (麦肯锡列出的AI自动化潜力前10名工作)
McKinsey identified the **top 10 jobs** (十大工作) most susceptible to AI automation by **2033** (到2033年). These jobs span various sectors, including:

- **Office work** (办公工作)
- **Mechanical installation and repair** (机械安装与维修)
- **Business and legal professional work** (商业与法律专业工作)
- **Customer service and sales** (客户服务与销售)

One significant factor contributing to AI's increased potential for automating these jobs is the development of **generative AI** (生成型AI), which can now handle tasks related to **writing**, **communication**, and **empathy**, areas previously thought to be less automatable.

### 3.2 Impact on Writing and Communication Tasks (写作与沟通任务的影响)
Generative AI's ability to generate **human-sounding text** (类似人类的文本) has made jobs involving writing and communication tasks more susceptible to automation. This includes jobs in **office support** (办公室支持) and **legal work** (法律工作).

### 3.3 Proportions of Global Workforce (全球劳动力的比例)
According to McKinsey's study, these **10 occupation groups** (10个职业群体) account for over **70% of the global workforce** (全球劳动力的70%) — a significant portion of workers worldwide.

## 4. Navigating the Impact of AI on Jobs (应对AI对工作岗位的影响)

### 4.1 Conditional Basic Income (条件性基本收入)
One potential solution is **conditional basic income** (条件性基本收入), where governments provide a safety net for unemployed individuals but incentivize them to keep **learning** (学习) and **upgrading their skills** (提升技能). This encourages personal development and helps people reenter the workforce.

### 4.2 Lifelong Learning Society (终身学习社会)
Building a **lifelong learning society** (终身学习社会) is essential. Traditional models of education, where individuals attend college for a few years and then stop learning, are no longer sufficient. Instead, individuals should continue learning throughout their careers to remain adaptable in a rapidly changing job market.

### 4.3 Political Solutions (政治解决方案)
Governments can implement policies that incentivize job creation, such as **legislation** (立法) to ensure fair treatment of workers and providing support to industries creating new job opportunities. These solutions can help mitigate the impacts of AI on employment.

## 5. AI and the Radiologist Example (AI与放射科医生的例子)

### 5.1 AI in Radiology (AI在放射学中的应用)
A **radiology resident** (放射科住院医师) asked whether he should quit his career and focus solely on AI. My advice was to **combine AI with radiology** (将AI与放射学结合). By learning AI, he could become uniquely positioned at the intersection of both fields, bringing value to both.

### 5.2 Transitioning into AI (转型为AI)
It’s possible for anyone, even those starting from scratch, to **learn AI** (学习AI) through online resources. However, building on existing expertise, as with the radiologist example, can provide a more **unique skill set** (独特的技能组合) and make one more valuable in the job market.

## 6. Conclusion (结论)

AI's impact on jobs is complex, with significant displacement but also the creation of new opportunities. Solutions like **conditional basic income**, **lifelong learning**, and **political solutions** can help mitigate the effects. Developing economies, in particular, can leverage AI to create specialized industries and take advantage of **AI-powered growth** (AI驱动的增长). The key is not to fear the changes but to **adapt** (适应) and embrace new roles and opportunities as they arise.

In the next video, we will wrap up the course and discuss the broader implications of AI on **society** (社会). Let’s move to the final video.
