# Week 1 – Lesson 7: What AI Can and Cannot Do (Part 2)

## 1. Introduction

Building intuition about what AI can and cannot do often requires seeing both **successful** and **unsuccessful** projects. This video provides additional concrete examples to help shorten the learning curve and improve your judgment about which AI projects may be valuable or feasible for your organization.

## 2. Self-Driving Cars: What AI Can Do

AI systems are now capable of:
- Input A: Images and sensor data (camera, radar, lidar)
- Output B: Positions of other cars

This has been made possible due to:
- High-quality data collection
- Effective algorithms
- Large annotated datasets

This type of input-output mapping (A → B) works well and is widely used in self-driving car technology today.

## 3. Self-Driving Cars: What AI Cannot Do

Much harder: interpreting human gestures toward a car. For example:
- Construction worker signaling to stop
- Hitchhiker waving for a ride
- Bicyclist signaling a left turn

Challenges:
- Gestures vary widely between individuals and contexts
- Very difficult to collect enough labeled data to capture this diversity
- Understanding human intention is a **complex concept**
- Application is **safety-critical**, requiring extremely high accuracy

Due to these challenges, most self-driving systems do **not** rely on AI to fully understand arbitrary human gestures.

## 4. Medical Imaging: What AI Can Do

AI is capable of:
- Input A: Chest X-ray images
- Output B: Pneumonia diagnosis (yes/no)

This works well when:
- You have a large, labeled dataset
- The task is clearly defined as an A → B problem

## 5. Medical Imaging: What AI Cannot Do

AI struggles to learn from:
- Only a few textbook images
- Paragraphs of written explanation

A human doctor may learn from a dozen examples and a short explanation, but:
- AI systems lack the flexibility and general reasoning needed
- It's unclear how to structure textbook content into A → B mappings for AI

## 6. Strengths and Weaknesses of AI

### Strengths
- Works well when learning **simple concepts** (tasks humans can perform in < 1 second)
- Performs reliably when **lots of data** is available for both A and B

### Weaknesses
- Fails on **complex tasks** with limited data
- Performs poorly on **new data types** not seen during training

Example:
- Train AI on clean X-rays → good performance
- Apply AI to a different hospital with noisy or angled images → poor performance

AI systems are **less adaptable** than humans when facing unfamiliar input formats.

## 7. Takeaways

- It is normal to feel uncertain about what AI can or cannot do.
- Even experienced engineers often need time for technical diligence to assess feasibility.
- These examples should help you begin to identify promising AI project ideas in your own organization.

## 8. Looking Ahead

The next two videos are **optional** and provide non-technical explanations of neural networks and deep learning. Starting next week, the course will dive into the detailed process of building an AI project.
