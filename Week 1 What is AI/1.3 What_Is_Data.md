# Week 1 – Lesson 3: What Is Data?

## 1. What Is Data in AI?

Data (数据) is the foundation of AI. It refers to the **input-output examples** that help machine learning systems learn how to perform tasks.

> A dataset (数据集) is often structured like a table or spreadsheet (e.g., Excel), with columns representing features (inputs) and targets (outputs).


## 2. Real Estate Example

| Feature (A) | Target (B) |
|-------------|------------|
| House Size (平方英尺或平方米) | House Price (价格) |

- Basic use: Input = house size, Output = price.
- More complex: Input = [size, number of bedrooms], Output = price.
- Alternative use: Input = budget, Output = expected house size.

> It’s **up to you or your use case** to define what is A (input) and what is B (output).


## 3. Cat Recognition Example

- Input A = Images (图像)
- Output B = Labels (e.g., cat / not a cat)

Tradition: Cats have long been a humorous example in machine learning (thanks to the Google Brain project).


## 4. How Do You Get Data?

- 4.1 **Manual Labeling**（人工标注）
  - Label each input manually (e.g., image is a cat or not).
  - Often requires **hundreds of thousands of examples**.

- 4.2 **Observing Behavior**
  - E-commerce: Record user actions (click, purchase) = training data.
  - Factory: Monitor machine sensors (温度、压力), failure status (是否失败).

- 4.3 **Download or Partner**
  - Use public datasets (e.g., for images, speech, medicine).
  - Partner with data-rich organizations.

## 5. Misuses of Data

- Misuse 1: "Collect now, AI later"
  - Some CEOs wait years to build a dataset before starting AI.
  - Better: **Start feeding early data to AI teams**, get feedback on what's useful.

-  Misuse 2: "I have tons of data, it must be valuable"
   - Not all data is useful.
   - Let AI experts evaluate and guide what **actually creates value**.


## 6. Data Can Be Messy

 Examples of Bad Data:
- Incorrect values (e.g., house price = $1)
- Missing values (缺失值)
- Noisy or inconsistent entries

> Garbage in, garbage out（输入垃圾，输出垃圾）— quality matters.

## 7. Structured vs Unstructured Data

| Type | Example | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Structured Data**（结构化数据） | Tables, spreadsheets | Easy for computers to read |
| **Unstructured Data**（非结构化数据） | Images, audio, text | Easy for humans, harder for machines |

- Supervised learning works for **both**.
- Most generative AI today (e.g., ChatGPT) works on **unstructured data**.


## Summary

- Data is essential — but messy and often overhyped.
- Choose A (input) and B (output) based on **business goals**.
- Involve AI teams early to avoid wasting time/resources.
- Next: Understand the terms like **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science** clearly.
