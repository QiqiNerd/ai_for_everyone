# Week 1 – Lesson 6: What AI Can and Cannot Do (Part 1)

## 1. Introduction

Before committing to any AI project, it's important to understand what AI can realistically do. This lesson helps develop practical intuition by distinguishing between **feasible** and **unfeasible** AI applications. Technical diligence—evaluating whether the available data and problem structure match what AI can handle—is critical before starting a project.

## 2. Why Intuition Matters

Media and academic publications often highlight only success stories of AI. As a result, some executives develop unrealistic expectations, believing AI can solve nearly anything. This is not true. To select appropriate AI projects, you need to distinguish:
- What AI can do reliably
- What AI is **not** yet good at

## 3. A Useful Heuristic

A **rule of thumb**:  
If a person can perform a task with **less than one second of thought**, then it is **likely feasible** to automate that task using supervised learning.

Examples of feasible tasks:
- Detecting if a car is nearby (for self-driving cars)
- Spotting a scratch on a phone
- Transcribing spoken audio into text

These tasks involve straightforward input-to-output mappings.

## 4. Example of an Unfeasible Task: Stock Price Prediction

Consider predicting future stock prices based solely on historical prices:
- Input A: recent stock prices
- Output B: price one month later

Machine learning struggles here for several reasons:
- Historical price data is **not strongly predictive** of future prices
- Results vary wildly depending on implementation or the data window
- Financial markets are inherently **random and noisy**

Caveat:  
Some traders use **alternative data sources** (e.g., web traffic, foot traffic) to improve predictions. But:
- These inputs are complex and costly to obtain
- Even with such data, prediction remains uncertain

## 5. Rules of Thumb for Feasibility

Two additional principles help identify feasible machine learning problems:

### Rule 1: Simpler Concepts Are Easier
- There’s no strict definition of “simple,” but a task you can perform in under a second is typically a simple concept.
- Example (Simple): Spotting nearby vehicles from a car window
- Example (Complex): Designing indicators to estimate a company's sales

### Rule 2: More Data = Higher Feasibility
- You need **many examples** of both input (A) and output (B).
- Example:
  - A = images of phones
  - B = label (scratched or not)
  - With thousands of labeled examples, building a good classifier becomes feasible.

## 6. Summary

AI is transformative but **not magic**. Understanding its limitations is key to choosing worthwhile projects. Key takeaways:
- AI excels at automating tasks that require quick, routine decisions.
- Avoid tasks where outcomes are inherently unpredictable.
- Ensure that large, high-quality data sets exist for both inputs and outputs.

In the next lesson, we’ll look at **more examples** to continue refining your intuition about AI feasibility and limitations.
