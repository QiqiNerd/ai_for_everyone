# Week 1 – Lesson 4: Terminology from AI

## 1. Introduction

You may have heard terms like **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **Neural Networks**, and **Deep Learning**. This lesson clarifies what these terms mean, how they relate to each other, and how they apply in real-world business contexts.

## 2. Machine Learning

Machine Learning (机器学习) is about building software systems that **learn input (A) to output (B) mappings**. For example, given housing data:

- Inputs A: size of the house, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, renovation status
- Output B: price of the house

A machine learning system can automatically process A and produce B. These systems are typically:
- Deployed in apps
- Run automatically 24/7
- Serve thousands or millions of users

Definition (Arthur Samuel): *Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.*

## 3. Data Science

Data Science (数据科学) is the field focused on **extracting knowledge and insights from data**. For example, a team analyzing housing data might conclude:

- Three-bedroom homes cost more than two-bedroom ones of similar size
- Renovated homes sell at a 15% premium

These insights guide **business decisions**, such as:
- Whether to renovate homes
- What types of homes to build

The typical output of a data science project is:
- A report or presentation (e.g., PowerPoint)
- Strategic recommendations for executives or product teams

## 4. Comparison: Machine Learning vs. Data Science

While both fields deal with data, their goals and outputs differ:

| Machine Learning | Data Science |
|------------------|--------------|
| Runs software that outputs predictions | Produces insights and recommendations |
| Outputs B for input A | Helps guide decisions |
| Continuous operation (e.g., ad recommendations) | One-time analysis (e.g., advertising trends) |

Example from Online Advertising:
- Machine Learning: Predicts which ad a user is likely to click on.
- Data Science: Analyzes industries that aren't buying ads and informs sales strategy.

Note: In industry, definitions are not always consistent and the boundaries can be fuzzy.

## 5. Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural Network (神经网络) or Artificial Neural Network (人工神经网络) is a powerful algorithm used in machine learning.

- It takes input A (e.g., house features)
- Processes it using layers of artificial "neurons"
- Produces output B (e.g., price prediction)

These are inspired by biological neurons but are mathematically very different.

Deep Learning (深度学习) is a modern term for using **large neural networks**, often with many layers, to perform complex tasks. Today, the terms **neural network** and **deep learning** are often used interchangeably.

Key points:
- Neural networks are highly effective for learning A → B mappings.
- Deep learning is the most prominent technique in machine learning today.

## 6. Terminology Hierarchy

Here is a conceptual diagram of how the terms fit together:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The broadest field; tools to make computers act intelligently
  - Includes tools like:
    - Rule-based systems
    - Planning
    - Knowledge graphs
    - Machine Learning

- **Machine Learning**: A major subfield of AI
  - Techniques that allow systems to learn from data
  - Includes supervised learning (A → B), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc.

- **Deep Learning / Neural Networks**:
  - A powerful subset of machine learning
  - Especially effective for supervised learning

- **Data Science**:
  - A field that uses tools from AI, ML, and deep learning
  - Also includes statistics, business intelligence, and domain-specific analysis
  - Focuses on gaining insights and guiding decisions

Note: Some people say Data Science is a subset of AI, others say AI is a subset of Data Science. It depends on context and usage.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

- What Machine Learning is: building systems that learn from data
- What Data Science is: extracting business-relevant insights from data
- What Deep Learning and Neural Networks are: powerful tools for A → B learning
- How these terms relate within the broader field of AI

This foundational knowledge will help you communicate clearly about AI and consider how to apply it in your organization.
