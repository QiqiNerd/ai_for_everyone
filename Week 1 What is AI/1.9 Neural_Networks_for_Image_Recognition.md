# Week 1 – Lesson 9: Neural Networks for Image Recognition

## 1. Introduction

This lesson builds on the previous video where neural networks were applied to **demand prediction**. Now, we explore how neural networks can interpret **images**—specifically, how they can recognize faces.

## 2. The Problem: Face Recognition

Goal:
- Input A: A digital image of a person's face
- Output B: The identity (name) of the person

How can a neural network process such complex visual input and make accurate predictions?

## 3. How Computers See Images

To a computer:
- An image is a **grid of pixel values**.
  - **Grayscale image**: Each pixel is represented by **one number** (brightness level).
  - **Color image**: Each pixel is represented by **three numbers** for **Red, Green, Blue (RGB)**.

Example:
- A 1000 × 1000 grayscale image → 1,000,000 input values
- A 1000 × 1000 color image → 3,000,000 input values (R, G, B for each pixel)

The neural network's job is to process all these numbers and predict who is in the image.

## 4. Neural Network Structure for Image Input

- Like the T-shirt example, each input (pixel value) feeds into the network.
- But here, instead of four input features, the network may process **millions**.
- As before, the network uses **artificial neurons (人工神经元)** to process the input step by step.

Key point:
- You do **not** need to program how the network should interpret the image.
- The network **learns automatically** from labeled training data (input image A and known identity B).

## 5. Learning Features Automatically

What the network learns internally:
- Early layers: detect **edges** and **basic textures** (e.g., lines, corners)
- Middle layers: detect **facial parts** (e.g., eyes, noses, mouths)
- Later layers: identify **face structures** and **patterns unique to individuals**
- Final layer: outputs predicted identity

This layered processing is what makes deep learning so powerful—it builds **hierarchical understanding** of the image.

## 6. The Learning Process

Training steps:
1. Feed input image A (pixels)
2. Feed the correct label B (identity)
3. The algorithm adjusts internal neuron computations to reduce prediction errors
4. With **enough data**, the system becomes accurate over time

Again, you do **not** need to specify how to extract features—the system **learns all internal computations** on its own.

## 7. Summary

- Neural networks can handle very complex inputs like images by processing them through layers of artificial neurons.
- With large datasets of images and correct labels, neural networks can learn to recognize faces with high accuracy.
- The process is **data-driven**, **automatic**, and increasingly effective at scale.
- You now have a foundational understanding of how neural networks can be used for both structured (demand prediction) and unstructured (image recognition) data.

Congratulations on completing Week 1 of the course. In Week 2, you will begin learning how to **build your own AI or data science project**.
