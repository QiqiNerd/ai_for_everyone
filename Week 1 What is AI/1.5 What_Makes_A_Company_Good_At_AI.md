# Week 1 – Lesson 5: What Makes a Company Good at AI

## 1. Introduction

What does it mean for a company to be good at AI? More importantly, what does it take for your company to become one? This lesson draws on insights from Andrew Ng’s leadership roles at Google Brain and Baidu AI, and highlights key principles companies must follow to effectively transform into AI-first organizations.

## 2. Lessons from the Internet Era

Building a website does not automatically make a company an "Internet company." For example, a shopping mall with an online store is not equivalent to a company like Amazon.

Key characteristics of true Internet companies:
- **Pervasive A/B Testing**: Regularly test variations of websites to optimize performance and user engagement.
- **Short Iteration Cycles**: Products can be updated weekly or even daily.
- **Decentralized Decision Making**: Engineers and product managers—not just executives—make technology-driven decisions.

These practices take full advantage of what the internet enables.

## 3. Applying This to the AI Era

Similarly, using a few neural networks or deep learning algorithms does **not** make a company an AI company. Instead, great AI companies do things that AI enables particularly well.

## 4. Characteristics of Great AI Companies

1. **Strategic Data Acquisition**
   - Launch data-generating products, even if they do not generate revenue directly.
   - Use these products to collect data that can be monetized elsewhere.

2. **Unified Data Warehouses**
   - Centralize data access rather than fragmenting it across departments.
   - Enable engineers to "connect the dots" using data.
   - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as **GDPR**.

3. **Spotting Automation Opportunities**
   - Identify tasks that can be automated using supervised learning (A → B mapping).
   - Use AI to reduce manual labor and improve efficiency.

4. **New Organizational Roles and Structures**
   - Roles like **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)** emerge.
   - AI companies reorganize teams to support effective AI development and deployment.

These companies are structured to consistently take advantage of what AI can do well.

## 5. Becoming a Good AI Company: A Systematic Process

Becoming good at AI is **not magical**. It requires a systematic transformation process. Andrew Ng outlines a five-step **AI Transformation Playbook**:

### Step 1: Execute Pilot Projects
- Start small to build momentum and learn what AI can and cannot do.
- Projects can be done in-house or outsourced.

### Step 2: Build In-House AI Capabilities
- Form internal AI teams.
- Train not only engineers but also managers and executives.

### Step 3: Develop an AI Strategy
- Define how AI fits into the broader business goals.
- Decide which areas will be most impacted by AI.

### Step 4: Communicate Internally and Externally
- Ensure employees, customers, and investors understand and support the AI vision.

These steps have helped companies like Google, Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft evolve into AI leaders.

## 6. Creating Value Across Industries

- AI already creates value in the software industry.
- Its future value will increasingly come from non-software sectors.
- If you help your company become proficient in AI, you can drive substantial impact.

## 7. Summary

- True AI companies do more than just use AI—they are structured around its strengths.
- Strategic data collection, unified infrastructure, and AI-specific roles are crucial.
- The AI Transformation Playbook offers a roadmap for becoming great at AI.
- You can lead this transformation by guiding your organization through these steps.
