# Week 1 – Lesson 8: Important Terminology – Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

The terms **deep learning (深度学习)** and **neural networks (神经网络)** are widely used in AI and are often used interchangeably. This lesson explains what they really mean through intuitive examples and clears up some of the mystique around them.

## 2. Simple Neural Network Example – Demand Prediction

Imagine you're running an online store that sells t-shirts. You want to predict how many units will sell depending on the price.

- Input A: Price of the t-shirt
- Output B: Expected demand

A simple neural network:
- Takes price as input
- Outputs estimated demand
- The function might be a straight or curved line (e.g., price goes up, demand goes down)

This system can be represented by:
- A **single artificial neuron (人工神经元)** (a small computation unit)
- This neuron computes the function from price to demand

In neural network diagrams:
- Input → Neuron → Output
- Neurons are often drawn as **circles**, and act like small mathematical functions

## 3. Neural Networks as "Lego Blocks"

A **neural network** is built by stacking many artificial neurons (like LEGO bricks). Each one does a small computation, but together they can model **complex relationships**.

## 4. A More Complex Neural Network

Now you want to consider more features that influence demand:
- Price
- Shipping cost
- Marketing budget
- Material quality

These can be passed through different artificial neurons:
- **Affordability Neuron**: inputs price and shipping cost
- **Awareness Neuron**: inputs marketing budget
- **Perceived Quality Neuron**: inputs marketing, price, and material
- **Demand Neuron**: inputs outputs from the three above and predicts demand

This small network has:
- 4 neurons
- 4 input features (A)
- 1 output (B = predicted demand)

In practice, real networks can have **thousands or millions of neurons**.

## 5. The Power of Neural Networks

Key capability:
- You **don’t** need to manually define affordability or awareness yourself.
- You simply give the network:
  - Input A (price, marketing, etc.)
  - Output B (observed demand)
- The network **automatically learns** what internal features (like affordability) are useful for predicting demand.

This is called **training** a neural network:
- Provide many A-B examples
- The algorithm learns how to adjust its internal neurons to minimize prediction error

## 6. Deep Learning

When a neural network becomes **very large**, especially with many layers of neurons stacked together, it is often referred to as **deep learning** (深度学习).

- Early terminology: "neural networks"
- Modern branding: "deep learning"
- Both refer to the same fundamental idea, though deep learning usually implies greater complexity and scale

## 7. Summary

- **Neural Network (神经网络)**: A system of interconnected artificial neurons used to approximate functions from input to output
- **Artificial Neuron (人工神经元)**: A basic unit that performs a simple computation
- **Deep Learning (深度学习)**: A term for large, layered neural networks capable of handling very complex tasks
- The network learns automatically from A-B data pairs
- Neural networks are flexible, powerful, and widely used in modern AI systems

In this lesson, neural networks were applied to a **demand prediction** task. In the next video, you will see how they can be applied to **face recognition**, a more complex use case.
