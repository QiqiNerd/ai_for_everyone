# Week 1: Introduction to AI
## 1. What You’ll Learn in This Course
This is a non-technical course aimed at helping you understand and navigate AI—whether in your personal life, workplace, or organization.

It’s for:

- People curious about AI buzzwords

- Those who want to apply AI in practical settings

- Anyone interested in AI’s impact on society (社会影响)

The goal is to provide a realistic view of what AI is and what it can (and cannot) do.

## 2. The Economic Impact of AI
According to McKinsey Global Institute, AI could add $13–22 trillion of value per year by 2033.

Of this, $4 trillion may come from Generative AI (生成式人工智能), which creates:

- Text (e.g., ChatGPT)

- Images (e.g., DALL·E)

- Audio (e.g., AI voice synthesis)

However, the majority of value will still come from more established forms of AI like Supervised Learning (监督学习), which the course will focus on.

## 3. AI Beyond the Tech Industry
AI already creates massive value in software industries.

But most of the future potential lies outside tech:

- Retail (零售)

- Travel (旅游)

- Transportation (交通)

- Automotive (汽车)

- Materials and Manufacturing (材料与制造业)

Andrew Ng jokingly says that every industry will be impacted by AI—except maybe hairdressing (理发)… though even that may be possible someday with robotics!

## 4. Understanding Different Types of AI
### 4.1 Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)（人工窄智能）
Current dominant form of AI.

   Specializes in one task: “one-trick ponies” (只会一招的AI). While narrow, these can be extremely valuable when applied well.

Examples:

- Smart speakers (智能音箱)

- Self-driving cars (自动驾驶汽车)

- Search engines (搜索引擎)

- Agricultural/factory AI (农业或工厂的AI)


### 4.2 Generative AI（生成式AI）
A new class of AI that can generate creative content.

Models like ChatGPT are multi-functional:

- Text summarizer

- Brainstorming tool

- Copy editor

These systems are not limited to one task, unlike traditional ANI.

### 4.3 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)（人工通用智能）
A future, hypothetical AI that can do any intellectual task a human can—or even exceed human intelligence.

Despite public hype, AGI is still very far away.

May take decades or even centuries to achieve.

We need multiple technological breakthroughs before AGI becomes possible.

Important Insight: Because of rapid progress in ANI and generative AI, some people wrongly assume AGI is near, leading to unfounded fears of robot domination.
