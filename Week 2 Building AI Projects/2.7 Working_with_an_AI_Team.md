# Week 2 – Lesson 7: Working with an AI Team

## 1. Introduction

If you've found an exciting AI project, how do you work with an **AI team (人工智能团队)** to make it happen? In this video, you'll learn how AI teams think about data and how you can collaborate effectively with them to succeed on your project.

There’s a caveat though: If you don’t have access to an AI team or AI engineers, you can still get started with online courses in **machine learning (机器学习)** or **deep learning (深度学习)** to give yourself or your team the skills needed to start the project.

## 2. Defining Acceptance Criteria

The first step in working with an AI team is to **specify (指定)** an **acceptance criterion (验收标准)**. For example, let’s assume your goal is to build a system that detects defects in coffee mugs with at least **95% accuracy (95%的准确度)**. This can be the **acceptance criterion (验收标准)** for your project.

### 2.1 The Test Set

To measure this **accuracy (准确度)**, the AI team needs a **dataset (数据集)** for evaluation. This dataset should include images and their labels (e.g., whether the coffee mug is **okay (正常的)** or **defective (有缺陷的)**). This evaluation dataset is often called the **test set (测试集)**.

Typically, the **test set (测试集)** is not huge—maybe a **1,000 pictures (1000张图片)** would suffice. The AI team will use this test set to measure the accuracy of the model’s performance.

### 2.2 Statistical Performance

AI systems often measure performance **statistically (统计上)**, not perfectly. For example, you may request an AI system to achieve a certain **accuracy (准确度)**, like 95%, but you need to understand that **perfect (完美的)** accuracy is not always realistic. 

## 3. Training and Test Sets

AI teams usually work with two key datasets:

- **Training set (训练集)**: A set of images with labels to teach the AI model the desired output.
- **Test set (测试集)**: A separate dataset used to evaluate how well the trained model performs on unseen data.

### 3.1 Example of Training Set

In this example, the **training set (训练集)** might consist of images of coffee mugs and their labels, where each image is labeled as either **okay (正常的)** or **defective (有缺陷的)**. The AI system will learn to map the input image (A) to the output label (B).

### 3.2 Evaluating Performance

Once the AI system is trained, the **test set (测试集)** is used to evaluate the model's performance. If the AI system predicts **okay (正常的)** for two out of three images, it’s **66.7% accurate (准确度)**.

## 4. Two Test Sets

For technical reasons, some AI teams may use **two test sets (两个测试集)**. This includes:

- **Development or dev set (开发集)**
- **Validation test set (验证测试集)**

AI engineers may require both to ensure thorough evaluation of the model. 

## 5. Pitfalls to Avoid: Expecting 100% Accuracy

Don’t expect **100% accuracy (100%的准确度)** from your AI system. Some reasons for this include:

### 5.1 Limitations of AI

Current **machine learning (机器学习)** technologies still have limitations and might not perform perfectly for every task.

### 5.2 Insufficient Data

If you don’t have enough **training data (训练数据)**, the AI system may struggle to reach high accuracy. More data is often necessary.

### 5.3 Messy Data

**Data quality (数据质量)** matters. If data is mis-labeled or ambiguous, like calling a perfectly fine coffee mug a defect, it will hurt the AI’s performance.

## 6. Improving Accuracy

To improve accuracy, consider these steps:

- **More data (更多数据)**: Collect more images to improve training.
- **Clean data (清洗数据)**: Fix mis-labeled data or consult experts to resolve ambiguous labels.

Even without perfect accuracy, many AI systems are **valuable (有价值的)** and can still provide significant value.

## 7. Summary

In this video, you learned about working with an AI team, specifying **acceptance criteria (验收标准)**, and understanding **training (训练集)** and **test sets (测试集)**. You also learned to avoid expecting **100% accuracy (100%的准确度)** and to manage data issues, including collecting more data and cleaning it.

In the next video, we’ll discuss how to engage with an AI team to effectively execute your project.
