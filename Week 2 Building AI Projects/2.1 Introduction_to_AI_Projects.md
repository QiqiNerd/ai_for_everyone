# Week 2 – Lesson 1: Introduction to AI Projects

## 1. Overview

In the previous week, you learned the foundational concepts of AI (人工智能) and machine learning (机器学习). This week transitions from understanding the technology to applying it in practice. The focus is on how to actually build and manage an AI project—whether it's a small-scale personal project or part of a larger corporate initiative.

## 2. Goal of This Week

This week’s objective is to help you understand the complete lifecycle of an AI project. By the end of the week, you should be able to:

- Describe the typical workflow of an AI project
- Brainstorm and select feasible AI projects
- Organize both data and teams to execute those projects effectively

## 3. The Workflow of an AI Project

Like organizing a birthday party has a standard sequence of tasks (e.g., creating a guest list, booking a venue, ordering cake), an AI project also follows a structured set of phases. These predictable steps help manage complexity and reduce risk during development.

You will learn:
- What those steps are
- How they help define and manage the AI development process
- What it feels like to participate in an AI project

Understanding this workflow is essential whether you are working solo or with a team.

## 4. How to Select a Promising AI Project

There are countless possibilities for applying AI. One challenge is determining where to begin and which projects are worth your time and resources.

This week, you will be introduced to a structured framework for:
- Brainstorming ideas
- Evaluating feasibility (可行性)
- Selecting impactful and achievable projects

This framework applies to solo efforts, collaborations with friends, or large-scale enterprise initiatives.

## 5. Organizing Data and Teams

The third key area covered this week is how to prepare your data and organize your team to execute the project effectively. You will learn:
- How to gather, clean, and structure useful data
- How to assign tasks and responsibilities within a team
- How roles like data scientists (数据科学家), machine learning engineers (机器学习工程师), and project managers (项目经理) contribute to the success of an AI project

This guidance is applicable to both small informal teams and large corporate departments.

## 6. Expected Outcome

By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand what it feels like to run an AI project
- Be equipped with tools to brainstorm, plan, and organize one
- Be prepared to collaborate with others and turn your ideas into testable prototypes

This sets the foundation for taking your first practical steps in AI development.
