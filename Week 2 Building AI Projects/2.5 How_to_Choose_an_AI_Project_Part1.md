# Week 2 – Lesson 5: How to Choose an AI Project (Part 1)

## 1. Introduction

When starting an **AI project (人工智能项目)**, how do you select the right project to work on? Sometimes the perfect idea will come quickly, but more often, it takes days or weeks to come up with a viable project. In this video, we explore a **framework (框架)** to brainstorm and select AI projects that are both feasible and valuable for your business.

## 2. Selecting AI Projects

Imagine you want to build an AI project for your business. First, you must recognize that AI cannot do everything. Some tasks are beyond its capabilities. This means that the ideal AI project lies at the intersection of two areas:

- **What AI can do**
- **What is valuable for your business**

By focusing on this overlap, you can identify projects that are both **feasible** and **valuable** for your business.

### 2.1 Cross-Functional Teams

Often, brainstorming sessions will include both **AI experts (人工智能专家)** and **domain experts (领域专家)** who understand the business. These cross-functional teams work together to pinpoint the most promising project ideas at this intersection.

## 3. Brainstorming Principles

Here are some helpful principles for brainstorming AI projects:

### 3.1 Automating Tasks vs. Automating Jobs

Rather than focusing on automating entire jobs (such as the widespread idea of AI replacing workers), it's more practical to think about automating **tasks (任务)** within a job. For example:

- **Call center operations (呼叫中心操作)**: The task of routing calls or emails can be automated using machine learning, but many other tasks, such as answering customer questions, may still require human intervention.
  
- **Radiologists (放射科医生)**: While AI can assist in reading X-rays, radiologists still perform various other tasks, such as continuing education, consulting with other doctors, and mentoring junior staff. The AI project should focus on automating specific tasks, like reading X-rays, rather than the entire job.

### 3.2 Focus on Business Value Drivers

When brainstorming, ask:

- What are the **main drivers of business value (业务价值驱动因素)** in your company?
- For instance, if your business relies heavily on customer engagement, AI might help optimize customer support or enhance personalization.

### 3.3 Identifying Business Pain Points

Another critical question is:

- What are the **main pain points (痛点)** in your business that could be addressed with AI?
- By understanding the challenges your business faces, you can brainstorm AI solutions to alleviate these problems.

## 4. Small Data Can Lead to Progress

It's important to remember that **big data (大数据)** is not always necessary to start an AI project. Although more data is often helpful, **small datasets (小数据集)** can still be effective in some cases.

For example:
- If you're building an **automated visual inspection (自动化视觉检查)** system to detect defects in coffee mugs, you might only need a few hundred images of good and defective mugs to get started.
- In some cases, **10-100 images (图片数量)** may be enough to train a basic model.

Don't get discouraged if you don’t have access to a large dataset. **Small datasets (小数据集)** can be the foundation of a successful project, depending on the problem.

## 5. Summary

In this video, we discussed a framework for brainstorming AI projects:
- Focus on **tasks (任务)** rather than full job automation.
- Understand **business value drivers (业务价值驱动因素)** and **pain points (痛点)**.
- Recognize that progress can still be made with **small datasets (小数据集)**.

In the next video, we will explore how to **select (选择)** a promising project to pursue from the ideas you've brainstormed.
