# Week 2 – Lesson 4: How Data is Transforming Different Job Functions

## 1. Introduction

Data is fundamentally transforming a wide range of job functions across industries. This change is driven by the **digitization (数字化)** of society, where formerly manual or paper-based activities are increasingly recorded in digital format. Examples include:
- Online surveys replacing paper forms.
- Doctors maintaining **electronic health records (电子健康记录)** instead of handwritten notes.

This increase in **data availability (数据可用性)** means that many job functions—whether in recruiting, sales, marketing, manufacturing, or agriculture—can now benefit from **data science (数据科学)** and **machine learning (机器学习)**.

## 2. Sales

### 2.1 Data Science in Sales
- **Sales funnel (销售漏斗)** optimization is a common use case.
- Data science teams analyze customer behavior across different stages of the funnel to improve conversion rates.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Sales
- Machine learning can be used to prioritize **sales leads (销售线索)**.
- Example: Prioritizing outreach to the CEO of a large company over an intern at a small company.
- This is known as **lead scoring (线索评分)** and helps make sales teams more efficient.

## 3. Manufacturing

### 3.1 Data Science in Manufacturing
- Helps **optimize production lines (优化生产线)** by analyzing operational data.
- Used to identify inefficiencies, such as high defect rates during certain times of day.

### 3.2 Machine Learning in Manufacturing
- Applied in **visual inspection (视觉检查)** to automatically detect defects like scratches or dents.
- Reduces labor costs and improves quality.

## 4. Recruiting

### 4.1 Data Science in Recruiting
- **Recruitment funnel (招聘漏斗)** analysis can reveal bottlenecks.
- Example: If few candidates make it from phone screens to onsite interviews, the process may be overly selective.

### 4.2 Machine Learning in Recruiting
- Used in **resume screening (简历筛选)** to identify promising candidates.
- Raises **ethical concerns (伦理问题)** such as fairness and bias.
- Future lessons in this course will cover **AI ethics (人工智能伦理)** more deeply.

## 5. Marketing

### 5.1 Data Science in Marketing
- A/B testing (A/B 测试) compares two versions of a webpage to determine which performs better.
- Helps optimize user experience and increase conversions.

### 5.2 Machine Learning in Marketing
- **Personalized recommendations (个性化推荐)** based on user behavior increase sales.
- Example: Recommending blue shirts to users who frequently buy blue clothing.

## 6. Agriculture

### 6.1 Data Science in Agriculture
- Used for **crop analytics (作物分析)**.
- Data on soil, weather, and market conditions help determine what and when to plant.

### 6.2 Machine Learning in Agriculture
- **Precision agriculture (精准农业)** uses image recognition to apply weed killer only where necessary.
- Enhances yield while reducing environmental harm.

## 7. Conclusion

From sales to agriculture, data science and machine learning are reshaping workflows and improving outcomes. These technologies:
- Enable data-driven decision-making.
- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Introduce ethical challenges requiring thoughtful design.

In the next video, we’ll explore how to **select a promising AI project (选择有前景的人工智能项目)** to work on.
