# Week 2 – Lesson 6: How to Choose an AI Project (Part 2)

## 1. Introduction

If you have several AI project ideas, how do you ensure that the one you choose is worthwhile? Some projects may take just a few days, while others could take several months to complete. In this video, we will go through the process of due diligence that I use to evaluate whether a project is worth the time and effort to pursue.

## 2. Due Diligence Process

**Due diligence (尽职调查)** is an essential step before committing to a long-term AI project. In informal terms, it means carefully checking if your assumptions are accurate and if the project is truly feasible and valuable.

### 2.1 Technical Diligence

The first part of due diligence is **technical diligence (技术尽职调查)**. This step ensures that the AI system you want to build is actually feasible. Key questions to ask include:

- Can the desired system meet the **performance (性能)** levels you expect? For example, can your speech recognition system achieve 95% accuracy? 
- What level of **data (数据)** is needed to achieve this performance? Do you have enough data to support your project?
- How long will it take to build this system, and how many engineers will it require?

### 2.2 Business Diligence

The second part is **business diligence (商业尽职调查)**, which ensures the project aligns with your business goals. Key factors to consider include:

- Will the AI system create value for the business, either by reducing costs or increasing revenue?
- Will it help you improve existing business processes, or create new revenue streams or product lines?
- Financial models, such as estimating cost savings or projected revenue, can help quantify the business impact.

### 2.3 Ethical Diligence

Though not explicitly mentioned, **ethical diligence (伦理尽职调查)** should also be considered. It's essential to assess whether the AI project will have a **positive societal impact (社会影响)**. Consider if the AI system might unintentionally cause harm or exacerbate biases. In the final week of this course, we’ll discuss AI ethics in more detail.

## 3. Build vs. Buy

As you plan your AI project, a key question to ask is: **Should you build or buy (是自建还是购买)?**

- For **machine learning (机器学习)**, companies sometimes choose to **outsource (外包)** projects to access talent quickly. Eventually, you may build an in-house AI team for long-term development.
- **Data science (数据科学)** projects are typically done in-house, as they require **deep domain knowledge (深厚的领域知识)** to work effectively within the specific business context.

### 3.1 Avoid Industry Standards

A common principle is to **build (构建)** only what is unique to your business and avoid reinventing the wheel for **industry-standard solutions (行业标准解决方案)**. If a solution is widely available, it’s often more efficient to **buy (购买)** rather than build it yourself.

The metaphor to keep in mind is, "**Don’t sprint in front of a train (不要在火车前面奔跑)**". The "train" represents the industry standard solution, and no matter how fast you run, the train will eventually catch up.

### 3.2 Focus Resources on Unique Projects

Resources—**time (时间)**, **data (数据)**, and **engineering talent (工程技术人才)**—are always limited. Focus on AI projects that are unique to your company and will make the **biggest impact (最大影响)**. Use due diligence to ensure the project aligns with your business goals and will lead to valuable outcomes.

## 4. Summary

In this video, you learned about the steps for **evaluating (评估)** an AI project:

1. **Technical diligence (技术尽职调查)**: Ensure the AI system is feasible.
2. **Business diligence (商业尽职调查)**: Confirm the project aligns with business goals.
3. **Ethical diligence (伦理尽职调查)**: Consider the societal impact of the project.
4. **Build vs. Buy (自建 vs 购买)**: Determine if the solution is better built in-house or bought from a third-party.

In the next video, we will explore how to engage with an **AI team (人工智能团队)** and collaborate on executing your chosen project.
