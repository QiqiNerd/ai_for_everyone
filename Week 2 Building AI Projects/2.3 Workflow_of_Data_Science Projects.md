# AI for Everyone – Week 2 Lesson 3: Workflow of Data Science Projects

## 1. Introduction

Unlike a **machine learning (机器学习)** project, which often produces a trained model, the output of a **data science (数据科学)** project is typically a set of **actionable insights (可执行的洞察)** — conclusions that can inform business or operational decisions. Thus, the workflow differs significantly between the two.

This lesson introduces a structured workflow for conducting data science projects, using examples like optimizing an **e-commerce sales funnel (电商销售漏斗)** and improving **manufacturing efficiency (制造效率)**.

## 2. Case Study 1: Optimizing a Sales Funnel

Suppose you operate an online store selling coffee mugs. Customers go through a sequence of steps in the **sales funnel**:

1. Visit your website
2. Browse coffee mugs
3. View a product page
4. Add to shopping cart
5. Visit checkout
6. Make a purchase

### Step 1: Collect Data (收集数据)

You collect data tracking user actions — e.g., which pages they visited and when. You may also infer geographical information from IP addresses. In practice, you might track even more attributes like device type, referral sources, time spent, etc.

### Step 2: Analyze Data (分析数据)

The data science team explores the data and **iterates (迭代)** to identify trends or bottlenecks. Examples:

- High international shipping fees may deter overseas customers.
- Sales might spike or dip during holidays depending on user behavior.
- Cultural or temporal factors (like **siesta 午休**) might affect traffic.

These analyses help generate **hypotheses (假设)** and **suggested actions (建议行动)**.

### Step 3: Suggest Actions and Iterate (提出行动建议并迭代)

Suggested actions could include:

- Incorporating part of the shipping cost into the product price
- Reducing advertising spend during low-traffic periods

You deploy changes and gather **new behavioral data (用户新行为数据)** to re-analyze and refine the strategy.


## 3. Case Study 2: Optimizing a Manufacturing Line

Imagine you're running a factory making thousands of mugs monthly.

Steps in the manufacturing process:

1. Mix clay (considering water ratio, clay supplier)
2. Shape mugs
3. Apply glaze
4. **Fire the kiln (烧制窑炉)**
5. Inspect mugs for defects

### Step 1: Collect Data

You gather data such as:

- Clay moisture content
- Temperature and humidity
- Firing duration and temperature

### Step 2: Analyze Data

Your data science team examines correlations like:

- High kiln temperature + low humidity → increased cracks
- Afternoon heat → adjust moisture levels

Through **repeated iteration (反复迭代)**, they refine their findings.

### Step 3: Suggest Hypotheses and Actions

Insights may include:

- Operational changes (e.g., adapt humidity control)
- Scheduling adjustments

After implementation, you collect new data and **periodically reanalyze (周期性重新分析)** to optimize further.


## 4. Summary of the Data Science Workflow

The three major steps of a data science project are:

1. **Collect Data (收集数据)**  
2. **Analyze Data (分析数据)**  
3. **Suggest Hypotheses and Actions (提出假设和行动)**

Then repeat as necessary — data science is a cyclical, learning-driven process.

In the next lesson, we’ll see how **machine learning and data science** are transforming roles across various industries and job functions — including possibly yours.
