# Week 2 – Lesson 2: Workflow of Machine Learning Projects

## 1. Introduction

Machine learning (ML, 机器学习) projects aim to build systems that learn **input to output mappings** (输入到输出的映射), often described as A → B. This lesson introduces the **workflow (工作流程)** of a machine learning project using two real-world examples: speech recognition and self-driving cars.

## 2. Example 1: Speech Recognition

### 2.1 Collecting Data (数据收集)

The first step is to **collect training data**:
- Ask people to say the target keyword (e.g., “Alexa”).
- Record other non-target words like “Hello”.

This creates a dataset with audio clips labeled with whether the keyword “Alexa” was spoken or not.

### 2.2 Training the Model (训练模型)

Use machine learning algorithms to train the model to recognize whether a given audio clip (input A) contains the keyword:
- Input A: an audio waveform.
- Output B: label such as “Alexa” or “Other”.

> Note: The first version of the trained model usually performs poorly. Iteration (迭代优化) is essential. Multiple rounds of training, testing, and improving the model are typical.

### 2.3 Deploying the Model (部署模型)

Once trained, deploy the model into a real device like Amazon Echo. Challenges during deployment include:
- New user accents (e.g., British English vs. American English).
- Unexpected environments and audio quality.

You may need to **collect new data post-deployment** and update the model to improve performance.

## 3. Example 2: Self-Driving Cars

### 3.1 Collecting Data

The system needs to detect other cars from camera images. The dataset must include:
- Input A: Images taken from front-facing cameras.
- Output B: Annotations (标注), like bounding boxes (边界框) around detected vehicles.

Use specialized software to label the location of cars in each image precisely.

### 3.2 Training the Model

Train the model to map from image → bounding boxes of other vehicles:
- Initial versions may misidentify or miss vehicles.
- Through iterative improvements, the model gets better at recognizing car positions.

### 3.3 Deploying the Model

After training, deploy the model to real-world self-driving cars:
- Safety is the highest priority.
- You may find edge cases like new vehicle types (e.g., golf carts) that weren’t recognized.
- Collect new images and labels and update the model to handle such scenarios.

## 4. Summary of Machine Learning Project Workflow

The basic steps in an ML project:

1. **Collect Data** (收集数据)
2. **Train Model** (训练模型)
3. **Deploy Model** (部署模型)

Each step often involves **iterations** (反复优化) to improve performance. Feedback loops are key to successful deployment, especially in real-world applications.

In the next video, we will explore how data science project workflows compare to ML workflows.
