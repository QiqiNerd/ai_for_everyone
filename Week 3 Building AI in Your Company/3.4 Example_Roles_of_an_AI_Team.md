# Week 3 – Lesson 4: Example Role of AI Team Roles

In large AI projects, the team might consist of 100 or even more engineers. However, even if you're working in a smaller team (1-5 people), it's useful to understand the different roles that may be part of an AI team. AI is evolving rapidly, so the exact roles and responsibilities may differ across companies, but many companies share similar job titles for AI team members. These roles include software engineers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and more. This lesson will explore these roles and the types of work they are responsible for.

# 2. Key Roles in an AI Team

## 2.1 Software Engineers (软件工程师)

Software engineers play a significant role in AI teams. Their tasks include developing the software necessary to execute AI functions like controlling a smart speaker, setting timers, answering weather questions, or ensuring the software of self-driving cars runs reliably without crashing. In many AI teams, software engineers can make up a large portion of the team, sometimes over 50%.

## 2.2 Machine Learning Engineers (机器学习工程师)

Machine learning engineers are responsible for writing software that enables AI systems to learn and make predictions. For example, they might develop algorithms to map A to B or work with data (e.g., images of cars and their positions) to train neural networks or deep learning algorithms. These engineers ensure the AI models produce accurate outputs through iterative improvements.

## 2.3 Machine Learning Researchers (机器学习研究员)

Machine learning researchers focus on advancing the state of the art in AI and machine learning. They work to extend the capabilities of existing algorithms and techniques. Some researchers may publish papers, while others focus more on internal company research without publishing. These researchers push the boundaries of AI technology and play a critical role in innovation.

## 2.4 Applied Machine Learning Scientists (应用机器学习科学家)

This role is a blend between machine learning engineers and machine learning researchers. Applied machine learning scientists take cutting-edge research and adapt it to real-world problems. For instance, they might explore how to apply a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to a smart speaker. They bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application.

# 3. Evolving Roles

## 3.1 Data Scientists (数据科学家)

The role of data scientists is still evolving. Traditionally, they are responsible for analyzing data, deriving insights, and presenting these findings to teams or executives to inform business decisions. In some cases, their role overlaps with machine learning engineers, particularly when their tasks include building algorithms. As AI and data science grow, the data scientist’s role continues to adapt to changing needs.

## 3.2 Data Engineers (数据工程师)

Data engineers focus on organizing, storing, and managing large datasets. They ensure data is stored in an accessible, secure, and cost-effective way. This role becomes critical as data volumes grow significantly. For example, a self-driving car generates gigabytes of data every minute, and ensuring this data is stored and accessible requires serious data engineering expertise. Data engineers are key to handling big data and ensuring its usability in AI systems.

# 4. AI Product Managers (AI产品经理)

AI product managers help decide what AI products to build, ensuring that the product is both feasible and valuable. They need specialized skills to navigate the complexities of AI, understanding what is possible with AI today and what is not. This role is essential to ensure that the AI team builds useful and impactful products that meet the needs of the business.

# 5. The Importance of Scaling and Flexibility

AI teams can range from large groups with hundreds of engineers to small teams of just a few individuals. Even with a small team, you can still start exploring AI projects. For example, one software engineer or machine learning engineer can begin working with small data sets and build simple machine learning models. AI projects do not require large teams to start; you can begin with minimal resources and grow as needed.

# 6. AI Team's Role in Larger Organizations

An AI team doesn't operate in isolation. It must fit into the broader organization and contribute to the company’s overall success with AI. Understanding how AI teams interact with other parts of the company and how AI can transform business processes is important for achieving success. In the next video, we’ll dive deeper into how companies can transform through AI adoption and the steps required to make a company more effective at using AI.
