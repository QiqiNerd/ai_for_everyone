# Week 3 â€“ Lesson 5: AI Transformation

In this video, we explore how a company can become great at AI. This process is based on the experience of leading AI teams at companies like Google and Baidu. The AI transformation playbook is a guide designed to help companies on their journey to become effective at using AI. While this might seem like information for CEOs, it's useful for everyone in the company to understand, as AI can impact various projects and the company as a whole.

# 2. Five Steps of the AI Transformation Playbook

The AI transformation playbook consists of five main steps:
- **Step 1:** Execute pilot projects to gain momentum.
- **Step 2:** Build an in-house AI team.
- **Step 3:** Provide broad AI training across the company, including executives.
- **Step 4:** Develop an AI strategy for the company.
- **Step 5:** Develop internal and external communication strategies for AI.

These steps may not always follow a strict sequence and could overlap, but the order provided here gives a general sense of how to approach AI transformation.

# 3. Step 1: Executing Pilot Projects to Gain Momentum

The goal of the first few AI projects is to build momentum, not necessarily to tackle the most valuable projects. Early projects should be chosen for their potential for success rather than high business value. For example, at Google, the first AI project was focused on improving Google's speech recognition, a useful but not critical project. By succeeding in this project, momentum was created, leading to further collaborations with other teams (e.g., Google Maps, online advertising).

- **Key Focus:** Success and traction in the first 6-12 months.
- **Project Selection:** Pick projects with a good chance of success, even if they are not the most valuable for the company.
- **Outsourcing:** Early projects can be outsourced to gain expertise quickly and build internal capabilities.

# 4. Step 2: Building an In-House AI Team

A centralized AI team should be established, especially in large organizations. The AI team can be embedded within various business units (BU) to collaborate closely with domain experts. This approach allows for consistency in AI standards and practices across the company.

- **Centralization:** Build a centralized AI team to maintain consistency in hiring, retention, and AI standards.
- **Matrix Structure:** AI talent is embedded within different business units (e.g., gift card business unit) to develop AI projects in collaboration with domain experts.
- **Platforms and Tools:** The centralized AI team should also build company-wide platforms and tools that benefit multiple business units.

The AI team can be overseen by various senior roles, including the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), or Chief AI Officer (CAIO).

# 5. Step 3: Providing Broad AI Training

AI training should not be limited to engineers. Everyone in the company, including executives, should have a basic understanding of AI and its potential impact on their roles.

- **Executive Training:** Senior leaders should learn the basics of AI, how it can help the company, and how to make resource allocation decisions.
    - **Recommended Training Time:** Around 4 hours for executives to get a fundamental understanding.
- **Division Leaders Training:** Leaders of business units working on AI projects need to understand how to manage AI projects, set directions, conduct diligence, and track progress.
    - **Recommended Training Time:** At least 12 hours.
- **Engineering Training:** Engineers should be trained to build and ship AI software, as well as gather and manage data.
    - **Recommended Training Time:** At least 100 hours for engineers to become proficient in AI.
  
In-house training is crucial as there is a shortage of AI engineers globally. Online resources like courses, books, and blog posts can be used to train employees effectively without the high cost of creating original content.

# 6. Getting Started with AI Projects

Even without a large AI team, small companies or teams can start exploring AI by focusing on small, manageable projects. The initial goal is to gain momentum and lay the foundation for larger AI initiatives in the future. After the initial phase, the AI team can take on more complex and valuable projects, further driving the company's AI capabilities.

# 7. Summary of Steps 1-3

- **Step 1:** Execute small, successful pilot projects to build momentum.
- **Step 2:** Build a centralized in-house AI team and integrate them into different business units.
- **Step 3:** Provide broad AI training to executives, division leaders, and engineers to ensure a company-wide understanding of AI.

These steps help companies get started with AI, build internal capabilities, and create the foundation for future AI projects.
