# Week 3 – Lesson 1: Introduction to Building AI in Your Company

## 1. Overview

Welcome back! In the last two weeks, you learned about **AI (人工智能)** and how to build an AI project. This week, we’ll focus on how AI projects fit into the larger context of a company, whether it’s for-profit, non-profit, or even within government organizations. Although we will primarily focus on building AI for companies, these concepts apply to all types of organizations.

In this lesson, you’ll get an introduction to building AI at a company-wide level. The goal is to help you understand not just one AI project but also a series of **AI projects** that come together over time to make your organization more effective. While it might take two or three years to truly master AI and implement a series of valuable AI projects, this week’s lessons will help you visualize the journey and provide concrete steps you can take right away to start building AI in your company.

## 2. Topics This Week

Here’s an outline of what you will learn in the next videos:

### 2.1. Case Studies of Complex AI Products

In this section, you will explore case studies of complex **AI products**. Instead of focusing on a single machine learning or **data science module (数据科学模块)**, we will look at how multiple modules can come together to create more intricate AI products, such as **smart speakers (智能音响)** or **self-driving cars (自动驾驶汽车)**.

### 2.2. Major Roles in an AI Team

Next, you will learn about the different roles within an AI team. If you think your company could build a large AI team, perhaps with dozens or even hundreds of people, it’s important to understand the key roles these people will play. We will start to paint a roadmap for how an **AI team** might be structured.

### 2.3. AI Transformation Playbook

You’ll also learn about the **AI transformation playbook (人工智能转型指南)**, which helps guide your company to become not only capable of doing one or two AI projects but also proficient in handling multiple AI initiatives. This framework will guide you on how to make your entire company proficient in **AI**, increasing overall efficiency and value.

### 2.4. Concrete First Steps

Finally, while many of the steps discussed in this week’s videos may take a few years to complete, we will wrap up with concrete suggestions for how you can take the first steps toward building AI in your company right away.
