# Week 3 – Lesson 10: Survey of Major AI Techniques

AI and machine learning techniques have evolved significantly, and while **supervised learning** (监督学习) — learning A to B mappings — is currently the most economically valuable, other techniques are also worth knowing. Let's take a deeper dive into some of these essential techniques.

## 1. Unsupervised Learning (无监督学习)

One of the best-known examples of **unsupervised learning** (无监督学习) is **clustering** (聚类). Clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data without predefined labels, meaning the algorithm isn't given the correct answers in advance but instead finds patterns by itself. Here’s an example:

### 1.1 Clustering Example (聚类示例)
- Imagine you run a **grocery store** (杂货店) specializing in **potato chips** (薯片). You collect data on customer purchases, including how many packets of potato chips each customer buys and what the average price per packet is.
- Your store sells both **low-end** (低价) and **high-end** (高价) potato chips. Clustering will automatically group your customers into two clusters:
  - One group of customers buys **cheaper chips** (便宜薯片) but in **larger quantities**.
  - Another group buys **fewer packets** (较少数量) but prefers the **more expensive chips** (贵薯片).
- This clustering could help you identify market segments (市场细分), such as college students who tend to buy more chips at a lower price and professionals who buy fewer but more expensive packets.
  
**Why Unsupervised Learning?**
- Unlike **supervised learning** (监督学习), where you provide both input (A) and output (B), **unsupervised learning** doesn't give the AI a target output. Instead, the AI system is tasked with finding patterns in the data on its own.

### 1.2 The Google Cat Example (Google猫的示例)
- In a famous project, **Google** (谷歌) ran an unsupervised learning algorithm on YouTube videos, asking the AI to find patterns within the videos. 
- To the surprise of many, the system found **cats** (猫) everywhere, highlighting the prevalence of cat videos on YouTube. This result showed how AI could "discover" concepts like "cat" without any human supervision.
- **Key Insight:** Even without specific instructions, the AI can identify and learn patterns, showing the potential of unsupervised learning for discovering unknown relationships in data.

### 1.3 Unsupervised Learning vs. Supervised Learning (无监督学习与监督学习的对比)
- **Supervised learning** requires a lot of **labeled data** (标记数据) — for instance, thousands of images of **coffee mugs** (咖啡杯) for a machine to recognize coffee mugs. 
- On the other hand, **unsupervised learning** requires **much less labeled data**, making it a promising approach for the future of AI.

**Current Applications:**
- Unsupervised learning is already valuable today in fields like **web search** (网页搜索) and **natural language processing** (自然语言处理).

## 2. Transfer Learning (迁移学习)

**Transfer learning** (迁移学习) allows an AI model trained on one task to apply that knowledge to a different but related task. This is particularly useful when there is limited data for the new task.

### 2.1 Transfer Learning Example (迁移学习示例)
- Imagine you have a **self-driving car** (自动驾驶汽车) trained to recognize **cars** (汽车). Now, you need the car to recognize **golf carts** (高尔夫球车) in a new city where golf carts are common.
- Transfer learning allows you to take the knowledge the model has learned from **car detection** (汽车检测) and apply it to the **golf cart detection** (高尔夫球车检测) task, even with fewer golf cart images.
- This makes transfer learning a highly **efficient** and **cost-effective** technique in areas like **computer vision** (计算机视觉).

### 2.2 Applications and Importance
- Transfer learning is widely used in **computer vision** (计算机视觉) systems, where models trained on large datasets can be adapted to new tasks, improving **performance** (性能) without requiring vast amounts of new labeled data.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (强化学习)

**Reinforcement learning** (强化学习) is a technique inspired by how humans and animals learn through rewards and penalties. It involves training an agent to make decisions by rewarding good actions and punishing bad ones.

### 3.1 Reinforcement Learning Example (强化学习示例)
- Consider a **Stanford autonomous helicopter** (斯坦福自动直升机). The helicopter is trained using **GPS**, **accelerometers**, and a **compass** to understand its position.
- Instead of teaching it the optimal way to fly using supervised learning, we apply reinforcement learning. The helicopter is rewarded for good actions (like flying straight) and penalized for mistakes (like crashing).
- Over time, the AI learns the most efficient way to fly, maximizing positive rewards and minimizing negative ones.

### 3.2 Applications of Reinforcement Learning
- Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to **robotics** (机器人学), such as teaching robots to navigate environments.
- It's also been applied to **games** (游戏) like **Go** (围棋) and **chess** (国际象棋), with notable examples like **AlphaGo** (阿尔法围棋).
- **Key Issue:** While reinforcement learning generates significant attention, it still **requires vast amounts of data** and is currently less economically impactful than supervised learning.

## 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (生成对抗网络)

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** (生成对抗网络) are a powerful AI technique used to generate new, synthetic data, such as images or text, by learning from a dataset.

### 4.1 GANs Example (GANs 示例)
- **NVIDIA** (英伟达) has used GANs to generate **fake celebrity images** (虚假的名人照片). By learning from a large dataset of celebrity images, the AI can create completely new faces that look realistic but are entirely fictional.
- This technology has exciting applications in the **entertainment industry** (娱乐产业), **gaming** (游戏), and **media** (媒体).

## 5. Knowledge Graphs (知识图谱)

**Knowledge Graphs** (知识图谱) are an important AI technique used to represent information in a structured form, often used by companies like **Google** (谷歌) to enhance search results.

### 5.1 Knowledge Graph Example (知识图谱示例)
- When searching for **Leonardo da Vinci** (列奥纳多·达·芬奇), you might see a panel with **relevant information** (相关信息) like his birth date, notable works, and life events. This data comes from a **Knowledge Graph**.
- Knowledge graphs organize data about people, places, organizations, and other entities into a database that makes it easier to access and use.

### 5.2 Importance and Applications
- **Knowledge Graphs** (知识图谱) are widely used across industries to enhance search engines, improve recommendation systems, and organize large amounts of information efficiently.
- Despite their significant economic impact, knowledge graphs are **understudied** in academia.
