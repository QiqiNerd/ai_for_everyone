# Week 3 – Lesson 6: Introduction to AI Strategy and Communications

In the previous video, we covered steps 1-3 of the AI transformation playbook, focusing on executing pilot projects, building an in-house AI team, and providing broad AI training. In this video, we delve into the final two steps: developing an AI strategy and creating internal and external communications for AI. The aim is to ensure that AI not only provides short-term momentum but also contributes to creating a valuable and defensible business in the long term.

# 2. Step 4: Developing an AI Strategy

## 2.1 Importance of Developing AI Strategy Later

Unlike what some CEOs may initially believe, developing an AI strategy should come after getting hands-on experience with AI projects. This allows the company to better understand AI’s potential and limitations, which leads to a more grounded and actionable strategy. Without practical experience, AI strategies may end up being overly academic or based on external headlines, such as focusing on data collection without understanding the real needs of the business.

- **Recommendation:** Start with pilot projects and team building, and only then formulate a strategy based on the company’s understanding of AI’s applications.

## 2.2 The Virtuous Cycle of AI (良性循环)

A key concept to consider when designing an AI strategy is the **Virtuous Cycle of AI**. This cycle describes how an improved product can lead to more users, more data, and better AI-driven improvements, which reinforce each other. This positive feedback loop makes it challenging for new competitors to break into certain sectors.

- **Example from Web Search:** A better web search product attracts more users, generates more data, and, using AI, results in an even better product. This cycle makes the business defensible, as incumbents gain advantages from data accumulation.
  
- **Application to New Verticals:** New businesses in less established sectors can also leverage the Virtuous Cycle of AI. For instance, companies entering niche markets can use early-stage data collection to build better products over time and gain competitive advantages.

## 2.3 Blue River Case Study

**Blue River**, an agricultural AI company acquired by John Deere for over $300 million, demonstrates the Virtuous Cycle in action. Initially, Blue River’s AI product used basic data from personal cameras to identify crops and weeds. As the product gained traction with farmers, it generated more data, which allowed the company to improve the product and expand its user base. Over time, this data cycle made Blue River's business more defensible, especially compared to large tech companies that lacked such specialized data.

- **Takeaway:** Building a defensible AI business doesn’t always require competing with large tech companies; instead, it can involve collecting specialized data for specific industries.

## 2.4 Verticalized (垂直化) AI Strategy

AI should be tailored to specific industries. Large tech companies may excel at AI in general, but for most businesses, it’s better to specialize in AI applications for their particular sector. This approach helps companies avoid the need to compete broadly with industry giants and instead focus on building AI solutions that add value within their niche.

- **Recommendation:** Focus on AI specialized for your industry rather than trying to compete with large tech companies in every domain.

## 2.5 Data Strategy and Acquisition

A solid **data strategy** is crucial to the success of any AI-driven company. Leading AI companies are adept at acquiring and leveraging data in strategic ways. For example, some companies offer free services (e.g., email, photo sharing) to collect valuable data that can later be monetized.

- **Strategic Data Acquisition:** Companies can acquire data through consumer-facing services or partnerships that gather data for AI training.
  
- **Unified Data Warehouse:** To connect and analyze diverse data sources (e.g., customer complaints and manufacturing data), companies should invest in a **unified data warehouse**. This approach enables AI systems to uncover insights that may otherwise remain hidden across disparate data sources.

## 2.6 AI for Network Effects and Platform Advantages

In industries with **winner-takes-all dynamics**, AI can accelerate growth and reinforce network effects. For example, platforms like **Uber**, **Lyft**, **Didi**, and **Grab** are successful because of their large user bases, making it difficult for new entrants to compete. Similarly, social media platforms like **Facebook** benefit from network effects, where more users lead to more valuable platforms.

- **AI's Role:** AI can help accelerate user acquisition and improve the user experience, which increases the chances of success in network-driven industries.

## 2.7 AI Strategy and Broader Corporate Strategy

AI should align with traditional corporate strategies. For example:
- **Low-cost strategy:** Use AI to optimize processes and reduce costs.
- **High-value strategy:** Use AI to enhance the value of products, enabling premium pricing.

AI can augment both low-cost and high-value strategies by improving efficiency and product offerings.

- **Recommendation:** Tailor your AI strategy to complement and enhance your company’s overall strategy.

## 2.8 Ethics and AI

As companies develop AI solutions, it's essential to ensure that they make people’s lives better. AI is a powerful tool, and its impact should always prioritize the well-being of society.

- **Recommendation:** Build AI solutions that enhance human life and contribute positively to society.

# 3. Step 5: Internal and External Communications

## 3.1 Internal Communications

As AI becomes a central part of a company, internal communication is key to addressing any concerns or resistance from employees. This involves:
- **Reassuring staff:** Addressing concerns about job displacement and explaining how AI can enhance their roles.
- **Educating employees:** Providing updates and transparent information on AI projects to keep employees informed and aligned with the company’s AI initiatives.

## 3.2 External Communications

Effective external communication is crucial for explaining AI initiatives to various stakeholders, including investors, customers, and regulators.

- **Investor Relations:** AI companies must ensure that investors understand the company’s AI value and how it impacts the business’s long-term growth.
- **Government Relations:** Since AI is affecting regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, self-driving cars, finance), companies must communicate with governments to ensure proper regulations and public-private collaborations.
- **Consumer Education:** As AI products evolve, educating consumers on how AI benefits them and how the company ensures ethical AI practices is critical.

## 3.3 Talent Acquisition and Recruitment

AI talent is in high demand, so showcasing your company’s AI successes can help attract top talent. It’s important to communicate how AI is a core part of the company’s mission and growth.

# 4. Conclusion

The final steps in the AI transformation playbook—developing an AI strategy and managing internal and external communications—are crucial to ensuring that AI has a lasting and positive impact on the company. A well-crafted AI strategy that aligns with the company’s industry-specific needs and broader corporate goals, along with clear and transparent communication, can drive AI adoption and create a competitive edge. As companies adopt AI, they must also ensure they are ethically using this powerful tool for the benefit of society.

Next, we will explore common pitfalls that companies face when implementing AI. These insights will help you avoid potential challenges as you move forward with your AI initiatives.
