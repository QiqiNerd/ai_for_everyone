# Week 3 – Lesson 7: Introduction to AI Pitfalls

In this lesson, we will go over five key pitfalls that AI teams and companies often face when implementing AI projects. Avoiding these pitfalls will help ensure that your AI efforts are both successful and valuable. The goal is to use AI to build exciting, valuable projects that make a positive impact. By being aware of common mistakes, you can navigate the process more effectively.

# 2. Pitfall 1: Don't Expect AI to Solve Everything

While AI is powerful and capable of solving many problems, it’s important to be realistic about its limitations. AI cannot solve all problems, especially when it comes to issues that require human intuition, creativity, or deep contextual understanding. The limitations of AI may come from factors like:

- **Technology constraints**: AI systems may struggle to process certain types of data or handle tasks that require human judgment.
- **Data quality**: AI is highly dependent on data, and poor or limited data can lead to inaccurate or unreliable results.
- **Engineering resources**: AI projects often require specialized skills, and not all companies have the necessary engineering talent or infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** Do thorough **technical diligence** alongside **business diligence** to ensure that AI projects are feasible and valuable. Be clear about what AI can and cannot do for your business.

# 3. Pitfall 2: Don't Rely Solely on Machine Learning Engineers

Machine learning engineers are highly skilled professionals, but they cannot work in isolation. A common mistake is hiring a few machine learning engineers and expecting them to identify all potential AI use cases for the company. While they have the technical expertise, they may not have the deep understanding of the business needs and domain expertise.

**Recommendation:** Pair machine learning engineers with **business talent** to collaborate cross-functionally. This partnership will help identify feasible and valuable AI projects that align with business goals.

- **Business Talent:** Understand the company’s objectives and know how AI can be applied to create real value.
- **Machine Learning Engineers:** Provide the technical skills necessary to implement and scale AI solutions.

# 4. Pitfall 3: Don't Expect AI Projects to Work the First Time

AI development is often an iterative process. It’s rare for an AI project to be successful on the first attempt. Developing AI models, especially complex ones, requires repeated testing, data adjustments, and model improvements. Even with the best data and engineers, AI projects typically involve multiple iterations before achieving the desired outcome.

**Recommendation:** Plan for **iterative development**. Allow for multiple attempts and adjustments to refine the AI model and improve its performance. This requires patience and flexibility in your approach.

- **Iteration:** Expect to go through several cycles of improvement and fine-tuning.

# 5. Pitfall 4: Don't Apply Traditional Planning Processes to AI Projects

Traditional project planning processes that work for non-AI projects may not be effective when applied to AI projects. AI development often involves uncertainty, unknowns, and complex variables that make it difficult to set rigid timelines or milestones in the same way as non-AI projects.

**Recommendation:** Work with your AI team to develop more flexible and realistic **timeline estimates**, **milestones**, and **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** that reflect the unique challenges of AI development. This includes setting clear expectations for:

- **Timeline estimates:** Account for the iterative nature of AI and the need for flexibility.
- **KPIs:** Measure progress in a way that’s appropriate for AI, such as model accuracy, data quality, or performance on specific tasks.

# 6. Pitfall 5: Don't Wait for Superstar Engineers to Get Started

While hiring superstar AI engineers can be appealing, waiting for the "perfect" team before starting can cause delays and missed opportunities. There are many capable AI engineers who have gained expertise through online courses and self-learning. The key is to build your team with available talent and start working on projects as soon as possible.

**Recommendation:** Don’t wait for the ideal team—start with the team you have and begin working on AI projects. Many engineers, even those with non-traditional backgrounds, can deliver valuable AI work if given the right support and resources.

- **Focus on Building the Team:** Invest in training and building your team over time. Your team will improve as you work on more AI projects.

# 7. Conclusion: The Importance of Getting Started

Avoiding these pitfalls will set you ahead of many other companies in the AI field. However, the most important thing is to **get started**. Your first AI project won’t be perfect, but it will teach you valuable lessons that will improve your next project. With each iteration, you’ll build momentum and refine your AI capabilities.

- **Key Takeaway:** Start your first AI project, learn from the experience, and improve as you go. The process of experimentation and learning is what leads to long-term success in AI.

In the next video, we’ll discuss concrete first steps you can take to start your AI journey.
