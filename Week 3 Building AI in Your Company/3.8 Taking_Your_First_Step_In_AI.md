#  Week 3 – Lesson 8: Taking your first step in AI
## Reflecting on the Course

This week, you have learned valuable concepts about building complex AI products like smart speakers or self-driving cars. You've also explored the roles and responsibilities of AI teams, as well as the **AI Transformation Playbook** that guides companies in becoming AI-driven. While some of the steps presented—such as transforming a company into an AI powerhouse—might take a few years, it’s important to remember that **starting small** and taking incremental steps is key.

- **Key Insight:** Taking the first step is crucial. By taking this course, you've already made an important first step toward mastering AI. The next step is just as important, and it's within your reach.

## 2. Concrete Suggestions for the Next Step

After completing this course, here are some concrete steps you can take to continue your AI journey:

### 2.1 Collaborate with Others

Rather than tackling AI alone, consider collaborating with others, both within and outside your company. You can:

- **Start with friends or colleagues**: Ask them to take this course with you, or start a **reading group** where you can discuss AI-related books or resources. Sharing the learning experience can make it more engaging and help you explore ideas together.
  
- **Teamwork for projects**: If you have engineering friends, use your new knowledge to brainstorm small AI projects. Many AI projects can be done with just one or two people. **Starting small** is better than starting big and failing, as it allows you to build experience gradually.

### 2.2 Start Small with AI Projects

- **Practical Projects**: You don’t need a massive team to get started with AI. By taking online machine learning courses, you’ll gain the know-how needed to execute small AI projects. Whether it's automating a task or analyzing data, small projects help you learn while creating value.
  
- **Scale Up Gradually**: Once you’ve succeeded with a small project, you can scale up. As you gain more experience, you may want to take on more complex AI projects.

### 2.3 Hiring AI Talent

- **Hire Talent**: As your AI efforts grow, consider hiring a few **machine learning engineers** or **data scientists** to help scale your projects. Don’t feel the need to hire top-tier talent at first—focus on finding people who are capable and willing to learn.

- **In-house Training**: Build the AI expertise within your company by providing **in-house training**. This helps develop internal capabilities while ensuring your team is aligned with your business needs.

### 2.4 Appoint an AI Leader

- **When to Hire Senior Leaders**: Once you’re ready to scale up your AI efforts, you might want to appoint a dedicated **AI leader**, such as a **VP of AI** or a **Chief AI Officer**. However, starting with a small team of engineers or data scientists can often be more effective than hiring a senior AI leader immediately.

### 2.5 Discuss AI Transformation with Your CEO and Board

- **Engage with Leadership**: Discuss with your **CEO** or **Board** the potential for your company to execute an **AI transformation**. Ask whether AI can make the company more **valuable** or **effective**. If the answer is yes, this could be a strong case for beginning an AI transformation journey.

- **Long-term Vision**: Align your company’s leadership with the idea that AI is an ongoing transformation, not just a one-time project.

## 3. Final Thoughts

These initial steps vary in difficulty, but it’s important to start wherever you can and build momentum. Many people, both technical and non-technical, have successfully helped their companies adopt AI. By taking this course, you now have the tools to start similar efforts within your own organization.

- **Key Takeaway:** Start small, learn as you go, and keep building your AI efforts. The important part is to **take action**.

## 4. Optional Videos on AI Techniques and Applications

At the end of this week, there are two **optional videos** available that dive deeper into key AI areas. These videos will introduce you to some important AI techniques and application areas:

- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**

These videos are more technical, but they will help you communicate more effectively with AI engineers and deepen your understanding of these key AI technologies.

- **Recommendation**: If you’re interested in AI engineering or want to communicate better with AI experts, these videos will be useful.
