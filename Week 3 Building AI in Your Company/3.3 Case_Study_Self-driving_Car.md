# Week 3 – Lesson 3: Case Study: Self-driving Car

## 1. Introduction to Self-driving Cars

Self-driving cars are one of the most exciting products of the AI era, and they also represent one of the most complex AI systems in use today. In this video, we will go through a simplified description of how a self-driving car works and explore how different AI components come together to make these autonomous systems function.

## 2. Key Steps in Self-driving Car Functionality

A self-driving car uses multiple sensors and machine learning algorithms to navigate the world. Here's an overview of the key steps involved in deciding how the car drives:

### 2.1 Input Sensors (输入传感器)

The car takes inputs from various sensors, such as cameras (for images), radar, and Lidar (laser sensor readings). These sensors help the car "see" its environment.

### 2.2 Car Detection (汽车检测)

Once the car receives the sensor input, it needs to detect other cars on the road. This is done through machine learning algorithms that take the sensor data (pictures, radar, or Lidar) as input and output the location of nearby vehicles.

### 2.3 Pedestrian Detection (行人检测)

Similar to car detection, the car must also detect pedestrians to avoid accidents. Machine learning is used here as well, and the AI system uses the sensor data to figure out where pedestrians are located.

### 2.4 Motion Planning (运动规划)

Once the system knows where the cars and pedestrians are, the next step is to plan the car's motion. This is done using a specialized piece of software called motion planning software. The software decides the car's path and speed, ensuring it reaches its destination while avoiding collisions.

## 3. Detailed Explanation of Key Steps

Let's dive deeper into the three key components of the system: car detection, pedestrian detection, and motion planning.

### 3.1 Car Detection Using Supervised Learning (汽车检测：监督学习)

For car detection, supervised learning is used. The system takes pictures of the car from different angles (front, back, and sides) and uses machine learning to detect the presence of other vehicles. In addition to cameras, radar and Lidar sensors are also used to get a 360-degree view of the surroundings.

### 3.2 Pedestrian Detection (行人检测)

Pedestrian detection works similarly to car detection. The AI system uses sensors to detect the presence of pedestrians and their movement.

### 3.3 Motion Planning (运动规划)

Motion planning determines the best path for the car to follow. For example, if there is a car in front, the motion planning algorithm calculates the safest route, adjusting the car's speed to avoid a collision. If there is a parked car, the system calculates the path to overtake it safely.

## 4. Additional AI Components in Self-driving Cars

In a real-world self-driving car, there are additional components that help ensure the car drives safely:

### 4.1 GPS, Accelerometers, and Gyroscopes (GPS、加速度计、陀螺仪)

Most self-driving cars use GPS to determine their exact location. They also use accelerometers (IMUs) and gyroscopes to measure speed and orientation. This helps the car know where it is on the map.

### 4.2 Trajectory Prediction (轨迹预测)

In addition to detecting other vehicles and pedestrians, the car must predict their future movements. This component, known as trajectory prediction, helps the car avoid collisions even as pedestrians or cars move.

### 4.3 Detecting Lane Markings and Traffic Signals (车道标线与交通信号检测)

A self-driving car also needs to detect lane markings to stay within the correct lane and to identify traffic signals (red, yellow, green) to stop or go when required.

### 4.4 Obstacle Detection (障碍物检测)

Beyond cars and pedestrians, the car must also avoid other obstacles like traffic cones or even animals. The AI system must detect and navigate around such unexpected obstacles.

## 5. The AI Team and Specialized Roles

Building a self-driving car requires various AI components, and these components are typically handled by different teams within a company. For example, there could be separate teams for car detection, pedestrian detection, motion planning, and obstacle detection.

It is common for large AI teams to consist of specialists who focus on specific areas of the system. As you can see, building such a complex AI system requires a lot of collaboration across multiple teams.

## 6. Conclusion

In this case study, we’ve walked through the key AI components of a self-driving car, including car detection, pedestrian detection, motion planning, trajectory prediction, and obstacle detection. The process of building a self-driving car involves combining multiple machine learning algorithms, data inputs, and specialized software components to create a fully functioning autonomous vehicle.

In the next video, we’ll take a look at the key roles in a large AI team and how these teams work together to build complex AI products.
