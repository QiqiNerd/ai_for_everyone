# Week 3 – Lesson 9: Survey of Major AI Application Areas

In this lesson, we’ll explore several major application areas where AI has made significant advancements and been successfully applied. This survey will help you understand how AI is applied to different types of data, including images, language, speech, and more. The goal is to inspire you with potential AI use cases for your own projects.

## 1. Computer Vision (计算机视觉)

One of the major successes of **deep learning** (深度学习) is **computer vision** (计算机视觉), the ability of AI systems to understand and interpret images and videos. There are several subfields of computer vision, each with its own applications:

### 1.1 Image Classification and Object Recognition (图像分类与物体识别)
- **Image Classification** (图像分类) involves taking an image as input and categorizing it into one of several classes. For example, an AI system could classify an image of an animal as a **cat** (猫). AI systems can be trained to recognize various objects, such as **flowers** (花卉), **foods** (食物), or **animals** (动物).
- **Object Recognition** (物体识别) refers to identifying specific objects in an image, such as recognizing particular items in a picture, and tagging them.

### 1.2 Face Recognition (人脸识别)
- A popular application of computer vision is **face recognition** (人脸识别), where an AI system is trained to identify and verify individuals based on facial features. This can be used for purposes like unlocking devices or securing access to buildings. 
- The process typically involves registering images of a person’s face, and when a new image is received, the system compares the features to determine if the face matches.

### 1.3 Object Detection (物体检测)
- **Object Detection** (物体检测) goes a step further than image classification. Instead of just recognizing objects in an image, it also identifies their **locations** (位置) within the image. For example, in a **self-driving car** (自动驾驶汽车), the AI system detects the presence of **cars** (汽车) or **pedestrians** (行人) and provides information on their locations.
- This helps systems navigate environments more effectively, such as in autonomous vehicles or surveillance systems.

### 1.4 Image Segmentation (图像分割)
- **Image Segmentation** (图像分割) is an advanced technique that provides more detailed information about the objects in an image. Instead of simply drawing bounding boxes around objects, segmentation identifies **every pixel** (每个像素) and classifies whether it belongs to a specific object.
- For example, segmentation can be used in **medical imaging** (医学影像) to identify specific organs (like the **liver** (肝脏) or **heart** (心脏)) in X-ray or MRI scans.

### 1.5 Video Tracking (视频追踪)
- In **video tracking** (视频追踪), AI systems analyze moving objects across frames in a video, such as tracking **runners** (跑步者) in a race or **wildlife** (野生动物) in nature videos. This technology can be used in various applications such as **sports analytics** (体育分析) or **wildlife monitoring** (野生动物监测).

## 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) (自然语言处理)

AI has made significant strides in understanding and processing **natural language** (自然语言)—the language that humans use to communicate. Below are some of the main NLP applications:

### 2.1 Text Classification (文本分类)
- **Text Classification** (文本分类) is a type of NLP that involves categorizing a piece of text into predefined categories. An example is classifying emails as **spam** (垃圾邮件) or **non-spam** (非垃圾邮件) or automatically categorizing product listings into **electronics** (电子产品) or **clothing** (服装).

### 2.2 Sentiment Analysis (情感分析)
- **Sentiment Analysis** (情感分析) is a technique used to determine the emotional tone of a piece of text. For example, analyzing a restaurant review like “The food was good” and predicting it might be a **4-star review** (4星评价), or interpreting negative reviews, like “The service was horrible,” as a **1-star review** (1星评价).

### 2.3 Information Retrieval (信息检索)
- **Information Retrieval** (信息检索) refers to searching for relevant documents based on a text query. This is exemplified by **web search engines** (网页搜索引擎), where users input queries and AI returns relevant documents or websites.

### 2.4 Named Entity Recognition (NER) (命名实体识别)
- **NER** (命名实体识别) is a key NLP task that identifies and classifies entities in text, such as **names of people** (人名), **locations** (地点), or **organizations** (组织). For example, the sentence “Queen Elizabeth II visited New York” could have its named entities—**Queen Elizabeth II** (人名) and **New York** (地点)—extracted by an NER system.

### 2.5 Machine Translation (机器翻译)
- **Machine Translation** (机器翻译) systems, such as **Google Translate** (谷歌翻译), take a sentence in one language and translate it into another language. For example, translating the sentence “AI is revolutionizing technology” from **English** (英语) to **Japanese** (日语).

## 3. Speech Recognition (语音识别)

AI has also had a profound impact on **speech recognition** (语音识别) and audio data processing. These applications allow systems to understand and process spoken language.

### 3.1 Speech-to-Text (Speech Recognition) (语音转文本)
- **Speech-to-Text** (语音转文本) converts spoken words into written text. For example, a system might take an audio waveform of someone saying “machine learning” and convert it into text.

### 3.2 Wakeword Detection (唤醒词检测)
- **Wakeword Detection** (唤醒词检测) involves AI systems detecting specific **trigger words** (触发词) or wake words like **“Alexa”**, **“Hey Siri”**, or **“Ok Google”**. Once the system detects the wake word, it activates and starts processing commands.

### 3.3 Speaker Identification (扬声器识别)
- **Speaker Identification** (扬声器识别) is a technique where AI listens to a speaker’s voice and determines their identity. This is similar to **face recognition** (人脸识别), but for voices, and can be used for **voice authentication** (语音认证).

### 3.4 Text-to-Speech (TTS) (文本转语音)
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** (文本转语音) systems take written text and convert it into spoken words. For example, an AI system can take a sentence like “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” and generate natural-sounding speech.

## 4. Generative AI (生成性AI)

**Generative AI** (生成性AI) is a rapidly growing area that focuses on generating new content, such as text, images, and even music, based on AI models trained on large datasets.

### 4.1 Text Generation (文本生成)
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (大语言模型) like GPT-3 are capable of generating human-like text from prompts. They can be used for tasks like **content creation** (内容创作), **summarizing** (总结), and even **copyediting** (文案编辑) text.

### 4.2 Image Generation (图像生成)
- **Image Generation** (图像生成) systems, such as **DALL·E** (图像生成模型), can create images from text descriptions. For example, inputting a prompt like “A purple friendly robot eating ice cream” will generate a high-quality image matching that description.

### 4.3 Audio Generation (音频生成)
- **Audio Generation** (音频生成) systems can create music or sound effects from text prompts. These systems, such as **Stable Audio** (稳定音频) and **Audicraft** (音频创造), can generate unique audio tracks based on simple instructions like “drum solo, 140 BPM.”

## 5. Robotics and AI in Physical Systems (机器人学与AI在物理系统中的应用)

AI plays a critical role in **robotics** (机器人学), particularly in the areas of **perception** (感知), **motion planning** (运动规划), and **control** (控制).

### 5.1 Perception (感知)
- **Perception** refers to a robot’s ability to interpret its surroundings using sensory inputs like cameras, radar, or LIDAR. For example, a **self-driving car** (自动驾驶汽车) uses cameras and LIDAR to understand the environment and detect other vehicles or pedestrians.

### 5.2 Motion Planning (运动规划)
- **Motion Planning** involves calculating the optimal path for a robot to follow. In autonomous vehicles, this involves planning the car's movements to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and follow traffic rules.

### 5.3 Control (控制)
- **Control** refers to sending commands to the robot's actuators, such as its **steering wheel** (方向盘) or **brakes** (刹车), to make it follow the planned path smoothly.

## 6. Structured vs. Unstructured Data (结构化数据与非结构化数据)

While AI is often applied to **unstructured data** (非结构化数据) like images, audio, and text, it is equally effective for **structured data** (结构化数据), such as tables of data found in spreadsheets or databases. AI on structured data creates tremendous economic value but tends to be less covered in the media than AI on unstructured data.

### 6.1 Structured Data in AI (结构化数据在AI中的应用)
- **Structured Data** (结构化数据) typically involves numerical or categorical information stored in well-organized formats (e.g., relational databases). Machine learning is applied to analyze trends, predict outcomes, and automate decision-making processes in various industries, such as **finance** (金融), **healthcare** (医疗保健), and **logistics** (物流).
